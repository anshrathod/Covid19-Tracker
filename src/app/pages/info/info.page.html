      People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through
      small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These
      droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these
      objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in
      droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more
      than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

      The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.

      The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
      For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around
      the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the
      risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a
      new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large
      gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.
      COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries.
      Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or
      intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

      Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can
      cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for
      people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.

      We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and
      foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep
      informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel,
      movement and gatherings.

      3) Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.<br>
      4) Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).<br>
      5) Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).<br>
      6) Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your

      7) Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.<br>
      8) After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from

      face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.<br>
      9) Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.<br>

      2019. At this stage, it is not possible to determine precisely how humans in China were initially infected with
      SARS-CoV-2.

      However, SARS-CoV, the virus which caused the SARS outbreak in 2003, jumped from an animal reservoir (civet cats,
      a farmed wild animal) to humans and then spread between humans. In a similar way, it is thought that SARS-CoV-2
      jumped the species barrier and initially infected humans, but more likely through an intermediate host, that is
      another animal species more likely to be handled by humans - this could be a domestic animal, a wild animal, or a
      domesticated wild animal and, as of yet, has not been identified.

      Until the source of this virus is identified and controlled, there is a risk of reintroduction of the virus in the
      human population and the risk of new outbreaks like the ones we are currently experiencing.
